"""
Challenging to get structs to be recognized by EPICLib and still provide the
IDE inspection we're seeking for Python users. Current stategy is to create a class
with keyword only args. This will allow the use EPICLib C++ programmers are already
used to, namely:

sw = Speech_word()
sw.name = "whatever"

but it also allows Pythonistas to specify some or all of the vars in the initializer, e.g:

sw = Speech_word(name="watever)

level_left and level_right are still optional like in the C++ struct, but unlike there,
I had to move them to the end to satisfy Python.
