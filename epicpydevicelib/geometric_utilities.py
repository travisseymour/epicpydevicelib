"""
This set of simple classes is used to compute positions and directions in the plane, 
in both cartesian and polar coordinates, and also with respect to line segments
and polygon regions.

Most classes are defined with "struct" to make all members public by default.

These classes make no assumptions about units of measurement of distance. Angles
can be specified in radians, but radians can be converted to and from 
trigonometry degrees in which 0 degrees corresponds to (x > 0, y = 0), 
and 90 degrees corresponds to (x = 0, y > 0).

Point is a set of (x, y) coordinates. 

A Cartesian_vector is (delta_x, delta_y) - a displacement in Cartesian coordinates.

A Polar_vector is (r, theta) - a displacement in polar coordinates using radians.

Various overloaded operators support computations of positions and directions.

A Line_segment represents a line that passes through two Points in 
both parametric and general form. Functions are provided (mostly inline for speed)
for computing distances of a Point from the line, and intersections between lines.
There are two definitions supported for distance of a point from the line:
    1. The distance from the line extended infinitely past the endpoints of the segment.
    2. The distance from the line segment only, which is either:
        a. the length of the line that both passes through the point and is perpendicular
        to the line segment and intersects the line segment between the endpoints. 
        b. the distance from the closest endpoint if the intersecting perpendicular does
        not intersect between the endpoints.

The Polygon class represents a polygon as a series of Points for vertices that make up
the endpoints of a set of line segments. The last Point wraps around to the first point
to define the last line segment making up the polygon. A distance_inside function
is used to compute whether a Point is inside the polygon and the distance of the Point
from the nearest line segment.

class Line_segment:
    """
    The Line_segment class stores two endpoints and the terms of the general form,
    and precomputes for speed some values used in various calculations.

    In the parametric form, line is specified in terms of its endpoints, p1 and p2,
    the differences dx = p2.x - p1.x, and dy = p2.y - p1.y, and a parameter t
    that describes where on the line a particular point is, starting from p1.

    A point is on the line if its (x, y) coordinates can be specified as
        x = p1.x + t * dx
        y = p1.y + t * dy
        for some value of t.
    Note that p1 corresponds to t = 0, p2 to t = 1. So for a given (x, y), a value
    of t between 0 and 1 means that the point lies between the endpoints. A value
    of t < 0 means that t comes "before" p1


    In the general form, a point (x, y) is on the line if it satisfies the equation
        A * x + B * y + C == 0, where

        len = distance between p1 and p2
        A = -dy/len;
        B = dx/len;
        C = -(-dy*x1 + dx*y1)/len

    For speed, most functions are inline, and dx, dy, len, and c (numerator of C)
    are computed and saved when Line_segment is initialized.

    Note that x and y values are doubles, and if they have fractional values, some
    functions and tests that assume exact values will not be accurate.
    But if all coordinates have integral values, then functions such as is_horizontal
    should be correct.
